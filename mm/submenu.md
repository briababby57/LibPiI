# SubMenu

You can choose to accept suggestions and use it or decline. Anyone who offers code suggestions to one are then apart of that persons Main Network no matter if they accept or decline the code suggestions.

Suggestions will be detailed  & well organized the Network will not let anyone suggest code thats incorretly written or doesn't make sense. So if its not good code the Network itself will not let you submit.&#x20;
